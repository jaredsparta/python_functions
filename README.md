# Python Functions
- What are they and why are they useful
- How to create a function
- Best practices involving functions

**Why?**
- Used to repeat a block of code
- DRY = "Don't repeat yourself" -- functions allow us to follow this

**How?**
```python
    # This is how to create a function
    def <function name>(<parameters>):
        <code>

    # When you call a function, one must input the necessary arguements it needs to run
    
```
